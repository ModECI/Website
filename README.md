ModECI (Model Exchange and Convergence Initiative) is a multi-investigator collaboration that aims to 
develop a standardized format for exchanging computational models among neuroscience, 
cognitive science and machine learning. 

<h2>Our goal: a Model Description Format</h2>

We are aiming to define a <a href="MDF.html">Model Description Format (MDF)</a> which 
can specify a broad range of computational models which can be expressed as computational graphs.
This will promote replicability, model comparison, model integration, the exchange of theoretical insights,
and the leveraging of tools for model analysis and optimization across different software platforms and scientific domains.
